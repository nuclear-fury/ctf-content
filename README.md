Well I created this repo because i was too lazy to install linux so i rather use github codespace to use a terminal to run tools on-the-go and that too online without slowing down my machine with a vm !

Challenge 1 solved here was from BSidesSF ctf 2025 on 27/04/2025 (IST time) and it was about cloning the source code of a website with an exposed git directory, still need to understand a lot more about git as a tool, but got a really good understanding of how bug bounty hunters use exposed git folders to get the whole sourcecode for an application.
